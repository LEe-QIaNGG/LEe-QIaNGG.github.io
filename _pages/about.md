I'm a MSc student at [School of Science](https://www.scifac.hku.hk/), [the University of Hong Kong(HKU)](https://www.hku.hk/). I received my B.E from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). 
My research interests lie at the intersection of reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and domain adaption, with a strong focus on improving the efficiency and scalability of machine learning techniques in real-world applications.
